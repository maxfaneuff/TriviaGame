A repo for the trivia game hw

<h2>What This Game Is About</h2>
<p>This game is meant to showcase my use of intervals in JavaScript/jQuery.  It's also a display of my rudimentary talents with HTML, CSS, as well as jQuery</p>

<h2>How This Game Works</h2>
<p>A user clicks on the "Click to Begin" button, and then selects from one of four choices for each of the 5 questions.  The game keeps track of whether or not you got a question right, wrong, or left it blank.  Each answer prompts a right/wrong/unanswered response.  At the end of the game, a scorecard page is displayed, showing how you did</p>

<h2>Issues/Bugs</h2>
<p>One bug I could not solve is getting the question timer to reset itself before being displayed.  Right now, my question timer displays first the remaining time from the previous question, and then counts down from 10.  So it goes sometimes from 3 to 9, or 5 to 9, etc..  I tried coding the questionClock to reassign to 10 in several different areas, but in the end, I couldn't get it to work.  Would love to know why</p>

<h2>Additional Notes</h2>
<p>So I love Chappelle's Show and, to be honest, watching .gifs of him dressed as Lil Jon or Tiger Woods made working on this homework bearable.  Having said that, if anything in my game comes off as offensive, I'm sorry and that's not my intention.  I simply wanted to put a fun spin on this assignment that more accurately reflected me.</p>
